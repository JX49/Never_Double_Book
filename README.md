# Never_Double_Book
A javascript project that will validate room times and a given increment for that room against user input

## uses a reversed for loop
Other optimizations I considered were using case statements to prevent unecessary iterations, but the number of iterations likley for this project are likley < 1000 so Duff's device is considered, but not used.
